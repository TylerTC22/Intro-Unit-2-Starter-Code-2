                <h2>Inflation is a rise in prices, which can be translated as the decline of purchasing power over time.
</h2>
<p>The rate at which purchasing power drops can be reflected in the average price increase of a basket of selected goods and services over some period of time. The rise in prices, which is often expressed as a percentage, means that a unit of currency effectively buys less than it did in prior periods.</p>               <!--Add text, images, and links for section 1 below!-->

Inflation is sometimes classified into three types: demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation.</h2>

               <p>An increase in the supply of money is the root of inflation, though this can play out through different mechanisms in the economy. A country's money supply can be increased by the monetary authorities by:

Printing and giving away more money to citizens
Legally devaluing (reducing the value of) the legal tender currency
Loaning new money into existence as reserve account credits through the banking system by purchasing government bonds from banks on the secondary market (the most common method)

                 <h2>Inflation aims to measure the overall impact of price changes for a diversified set of products and services. </h2>
<p>The above-mentioned variants of price indexes can be used to calculate the value of inflation between two particular months (or years). While a lot of ready-made inflation calculators are already available on various financial portals and websites, it is always better to be aware of the underlying methodology</p>              <!--Add text, images, and links for section 3 below!-->
